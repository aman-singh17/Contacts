How to Run:
Download the zip file and extract it.
On any Mac machine that has react set up, open the Contacts-app folder in the terminal and run command 'npm start'. It should print a QR code and a web address. Now you have two options:
1. If using Mac iOS Simulator --- just press 'i' after running the command 'npm start', or
2. If trying to run on a phone android or iOS, download the Expo Go app and then scan the QR code in any app on the phone. The QR code will try to open the app. Just click open and check the contacts app. (Note: even if you are trying to simulate on mobile phone, you will still need to run 'npm start' on Mac set up with react)

What I have made:
I have made a contacts app that fetches json object from website mentioned in the email sent to me and shows the users as contacts. If clicked on any user's name, it will show the persons Contact Number, Website, Company and Address. To go back just click on the contacts button on the top left corner.
 

Note: if there are any problems I have also added screenshots of the app running on my device, Please have a look at them.
